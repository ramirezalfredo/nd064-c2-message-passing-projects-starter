Given the following statement: "This POC was built with the core functionality of ingesting 
location and identifying individuals who have shared close geographic proximity"

I've decided to refactor Locations API as RESTful for the user to test it out and create a new
gRPC based microservice that receives gRPC messages from UdaTracker mobile app. This service
will send location data to kafka in order to handle the volume of mobile devices during the
convention and that will require a new location consumer service to insert data from kafka
into the PostgreSQL database.

Connections and Persons API, have been refactored as a separate microservice exposing a
RESTful API to retrieve and insert data directly into the PostgreSQL database.
